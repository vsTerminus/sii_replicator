	 * 1974 CAT 1693 T.A.
	 * This was the OTR version of the D343 Tractor Engine.
	 * T stands for Turbo, A for Aftercooler. 
	 * 500HP is roughly how far you could push this engine with tuning alone. Seems that pushing it beyond this point would greatly reduce its lifetime.
	 * 675HP is an imaginary configuration for people who like the sound of this engine but don't want to give up the power they are used to having with newer engines.
